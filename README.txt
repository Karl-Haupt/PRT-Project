Software development has been an ever-growing field in the Information 
Technology sector, yet the demand for software engineers has also 
increased. Is this because the backbone of most industries relies on 
the IT sector to make strategic decisions and to improve day-to-day 
operations or has it been the lack of fundamentals taught to student 
in the IT sector?

According to hourOfCode.com(Blurbs and Useful Stats, 2021) only 47% of 
high schools teach Computer Science/IT. These statistics show us that 
there has been a lack of fundamentals being taught at a younger age 
before university. 

These impacts have effects on students that pursue IT at tertiary 
level because the core principles are not being taught at a younger age.  

In this project we want to contend the impact by providing a solution 
to this problem.

At 'Tuition' we want to help student/adults that would like to pursue IT
as a career. 'Tuition' would spefically focus more on Software Engineering
/Aplication Development. Students would learn complex IT infastructure such 
as Git & GitHub and Test-Driven Development.

'Tuition' project is to start with specfic topics and expand into different topics
such as Advanced Java Topic. This includesd asynchorous coding, the executive 
framework, Streams and Threads. 

'Tuition' is different from other learning platforms or Q/A platforms. At 'Tuition'
we combine learning and Q/A platforms into one platforms because we believe
at 'Tuition' that the best way to learn any IT infastructure is to practice it
